            We're talking away
            I don't know what I'm to say
            I'll say it anyway
            Today is another day to find you
            Shyin' away
            Oh, I'll be comin' for your love, okay
            Take on me
            (Take on me)
            Take me on
            (Take on me)
            I'll be gone
            In a day or two
            So needless to say
            I'm odds and ends
            But I'll be stumblin' away
            Slowly learnin' that life is okay
            Say after me
            It's no better to be safe than sorry
            Take on me
            (Take on me)
            Take me on
            (Take on me)
            I'll be gone
            In a day or two
            All the things that you say, yeah
            Is it life or just to play my worries away?
            You're all the things I've got to remember
            You're shyin' away
            I'll be comin' for you anyway
            Take on me
            (Take on me)
            Take me on
            (Take on me)
            I'll be gone
            In a day
            (Take on me)
            (Take on me)
            (Take me on)
            (Take on me)
            I'll be gone
            (Take on me)
            In a day
            (Take me on)
            (Take on me)
            (Take on me)
            (Take on me)
            (Take me on)
(Take on me)
